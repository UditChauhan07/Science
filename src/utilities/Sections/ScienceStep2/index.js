                  Polyphenols are compounds in many plant-based foods, such as
                  fruits, vegetables, tea, and wine. They are antioxidants,
                  which means they can help protect our cells from damage caused
                  by free radicals.

                Bruno MD is committed to furthering our understanding of the
                power of natural substances to improve human health and
                longevity. This goal is a moving target. One not easily
                achieved. Nature is not always willing to show us her hand.
                Pharmacology is another path to improving human health, and
                Bruno also does this. We are the third-largest pharmaceutical
                company in Italy today.
              </p>

              <p>
                Knowing both sides, we understand that some solutions for
                improving health outcomes are pharma&apos;s job. Still, we also
                know that many diseases that lead to the necessity of
                pharmacological intervention are often preventable through
                leveraging the best ingredients that Nature has to offer and
                unlocking some of Nature&apos;s secrets that she is reluctant to
                share with us.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the seemingly insurmountable problems of deploying
                nature-based solutions to improve health and longevity is the
                issue of bioavailability. In our pharmaceutical business, we
                customize molecules to interact with the human body in a precise
                and targeted way with largely predictable outcomes because we
                design them for specific receptors in the body. Nature does not
                play this way. Our bodies block many plant-based nutrients that
                would benefit our health. This low bioavailability is a function
                of evolution, and the problem is particularly acute with a
                special kind of plant nutrient known as polyphenols.{" "}
